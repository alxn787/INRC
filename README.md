# INRC stablecoin
Decentralized CDP Protocol on Solana A decentralized borrowing protocol built on the Solana blockchain that allows users to deposit USDC as collateral to mint INRC, a synthetic stablecoin pegged to the Indian Rupee. The protocol is secured by a system of over-collateralization and automated liquidations, with price data supplied by the Pyth Network.
